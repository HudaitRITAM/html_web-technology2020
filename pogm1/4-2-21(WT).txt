so we can past argument during the calling main method in every pograme exicution main method will be called from command frot from
that place we can pass argumnet to the main method that is received in formal argument of main method in the from of array.
example of command line argument; 
 **write pograme to print 5 name that is pased from command line argument
class command
{
 public static void main(String args[])
 {
  if(arg.length>0)
   {
    int i;
   for(i=0;i<args.length;i++)
   {
  System.out.println(zrg[i]);
   }
  }
  else 
  System.out.println(no argument);
 }

**WAP to perform addition of some intiger by using the concept of command line promt.

class add
{
 public static void main(String args[])
 {
  if(arg.length>0)
 {
   int i,s=0;
  for(i=0;i<args.length;i++)
  {
  s=s+integer.parsenInt(args[i]);
  }
   System.out.println(+s);
 }
 else 
  System.out.println(no argument);
 }
}

Abstruct class::
a class which declared with the stack keyword is known as abstruct class

     it can have abstruct or non abstruct method
     but viseversa is not true because absrtuct method can 
     be declared only in the abstruct class

there are two way to achive absruct class-
1.absruct class
2.interface
it canhave constructor ans static method also.
it can have final methods which will force the sub class not to change the body of the 
method 
Abstruct method;; a method which is declared abstruct dosen't have implementetion

example;;
abstract class Bike
{
  abstarct void run();
}
class Honda extends Bike
{
 void run()
  {
  System.out.println("runs safely");
 }
}
class Mainmethod
{
 psvm(String args[])
 bike obj=new Bike();
 obj.run();
}
}
